# 2048 Game

This is a project for the 2048 game as part of a C++ programming course. 2048 is a popular puzzle game where players merge tiles with the same values to achieve the highest score. This project is my implementation of the 2048 game, developed in **C++**.

## Instructions

1. **Objective**: The objective of the game is to reach the 2048 tile on a 4x4 grid.
2. **Controls**: The game is controlled using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or the corresponding keys (W, S, A, D) on the keyboard.
3. **Moves**: Players can slide all the tiles on the board in one of the four directions. All tiles move as far as possible, and if two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
4. **Board**: The board consists of 16 squares where tiles can be moved and merged.
5. **Move Order**: After each move where the player slides tiles, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears on a random empty square on the board.
6. **Game Over**: The game ends when there are no possible moves left (no empty squares and no tiles that can be merged). The player can then try to achieve the highest score.
